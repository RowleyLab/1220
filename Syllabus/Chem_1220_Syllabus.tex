\end{tabular}

\paragraph{Midterm Exams:}
There are four midterm exams administered in the testing center through Canvas. Each exam is to be completed in a two-hour session during the indicated week unless prior arrangements have been made. A sparse resource sheet will be provided for each exam, but students should prepare by memorizing appropriate formulas, tables, etc.

\paragraph{Final Exam:}
The final exam is a comprehensive and nationally normalized exam prepared by the American Chemical Society.

\paragraph{Quizzes:}
Quizzes will be given at the beginning of most days. The purpose of these quizzes is to provide practice for the exams (since I am the author of both quizzes and exams) and to encourage punctual attendance.

\paragraph{Achieve Online Homework:}
The Achieve online homework assignments are organized by chapter and are of substantial length. I recommend completing the assignments in multiple sessions (Achieve saves your work), as we cover new material each day. You can find a link to sign up for Achieve in our Canvas course.

\paragraph{Daily Textbook Homework}
Most days will end with an assignment of a few problems from our textbook. These problems mostly have solutions in the back of the book, so you are encouraged to check your work and try to correct your answers if wrong. The assignments are graded on participation only, and are intended to encourage daily engagement with the material.

\paragraph{Attendance Policy:}
Students are expected to attend class. If you must miss class, contact the instructor

\paragraph{Late Work Policy:}
Textbook homework and take-home quizzes will be due on a day when class is regularly scheduled. All work is to be turned in at the \emph{beginning} of the class period, and late work will not be accepted. Please note that online homework has due-dates at 11:55 pm, and will not be available after that time

\paragraph{Make-up Work Policy:}
In general, there will be no opportunity to make up missed work, including in-class quizzes. If you must miss class, please do any assigned work in advance, and arrange to turn it in early

\section*{Miscellany}

\paragraph{Scientific Calculator:}
There are many different ways to calculate figures during homework. It is tempting to rely on Online resources such as \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com}{http://www.wolframalpha.com}, or to simply use a calculator application on a smart phone. During exams, however, any devices capable of connecting to the Internet will \emph{not} be allowed. You will instead need a scientific calculator capable of performing exponentiation and logarithms for the exams. Using this calculator exclusively while doing homework will ensure that you are familiar with it for use during exams.

\paragraph{Academic Credit:}
According to the federal definition of a Carnegie credit hour: A credit hour of work is the equivalent of approximately 60 minutes of class time or independent study work. A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit. Credit is earned only when course requirements are met. One (1) credit hour is equivalent to 15 contact hours of lecture, discussion, testing, evaluation, or seminar, as well as 30 hours of student homework. An equivalent amount of work is expected for laboratory work, internships, practica, studio, and other academic work leading to the awarding of credit hours. Credit granted for individual courses, labs, or studio classes ranges from 0.5 to 15 credit hours per semester.

\paragraph{Academic Freedom:}
SUU is operated for the common good of the greater community it serves. The common good depends upon the free search for truth and its free exposition. Academic Freedom is the right of faculty to study, discuss, investigate, teach, and publish. Academic Freedom is essential to these purposes and applies to both teaching and research. 

\noindent Academic Freedom in the realm of teaching is fundamental for the protection of the rights of the faculty member and of you, the student, with respect to the free pursuit of learning and discovery. Faculty members possess the right to full freedom in the classroom in discussing their subjects. They may present any controversial material relevant to their courses and their intended learning outcomes, but they shall take care not to introduce into their teaching controversial materials which have no relation to the subject being taught or the intended learning outcomes for the course.

\noindent As such, students enrolled in any course at SUU may encounter topics, perspectives, and ideas that are unfamiliar or controversial, with the educational intent of providing a meaningful learning environment that fosters your growth and development. These parameters related to Academic Freedom are included in SUU Policy \#6.6 (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/06/06.html}{SUU Policy 6.6}).


\paragraph{Academic Integrity:}
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent (see \href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/06/33.html}{SUU Policy 6.33}). You are expected to have read and understood the current SUU student conduct code (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/11/02.html}{SUU Policy 11.2}) regarding student responsibilities and rights, the intellectual property policy (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/05/52.html}{SUU Policy 5.52}), information about procedures, and what constitutes acceptable behavior.

\noindent
\underline{Please Note}: The use of websites or services that sell or generate essays (including Artificial Intelligence) is a violation of these policies; likewise, the use of websites or services that provide answers to assignments, quizzes, or tests is also a violation of these policies.

\paragraph{ADA Statement:}
Students with medical, psychological, learning, or other disabilities desiring academic adjustments, accommodations, or auxiliary aids will need to contact the \href{https://www.suu.edu/disabilityservices/}{Disability Resource Center}, located in Room 206F of the Sharwan Smith Center or by phone at (435) 865-8042. The Disability Resource Center determines eligibility for and authorizes the provision of services.

\noindent
If your instructor requires attendance, you may need to seek an ADA accommodation to request an exception to this attendance policy. Please contact the Disability Resource Center to determine what, if any, ADA accommodations are reasonable and appropriate.


\paragraph{Non-Discrimination Statement:}
