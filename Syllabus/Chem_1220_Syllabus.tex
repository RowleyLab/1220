\paragraph{Midterm Exams:}
There are four midterm exams administered in the testing center through Canvas. Each exam is to be completed in a two-hour session during the indicated week unless prior arrangements have been made. A sparse resource sheet will be provided for each exam, but students should prepare by memorizing appropriate formulas, tables, etc.

\paragraph{Final Exam:}
The final exam is a comprehensive and nationally normalized exam prepared by the American Chemical Society.

\paragraph{Quizzes:}
Quizzes will be given either in class or as a ``take-home'' quiz. The purpose of these quizzes is to provide practice for the exams and to encourage punctual attendance.

\paragraph{Achieve Online Homework:}
The Achieve online homework assignments are organized by chapter and are of substantial length. I recommend completing the assignments in multiple sessions (Achieve saves your work), as we cover new material each day. You can find a link to sign up for Achieve in our Canvas course.

\paragraph{Daily Textbook Homework}
Most days will end with an assignment of a few problems from our textbook. These problems mostly have solutions in the back of the book, so you are encouraged to check your work and try to correct your answers if wrong. The assignments are graded on participation only, and are intended to encourage daily engagement with the material.

\paragraph{Attendance Policy:}
Students are expected to attend class. If you must miss class, contact the instructor

\paragraph{Late Work Policy:}
Textbook homework and take-home quizzes will be due on a day when class is regularly scheduled. All work is to be turned in at the \emph{beginning} of the class period, and late work will not be accepted. Please note that online homework has due-dates at 11:55 pm, and will not be available after that time

\paragraph{Make-up Work Policy:}
In general, there will be no opportunity to make up missed work, including in-class quizzes. If you must miss class, please do any assigned work in advance, and arrange to turn it in early

\section*{Miscellany}

\paragraph{Scientific Calculator:}
There are many different ways to calculate figures during homework. It is tempting to rely on Online resources such as \href{http://www.wolframalpha.com}{http://www.wolframalpha.com}, or to simply use a calculator application on a smart phone. During exams, however, any devices capable of connecting to the Internet will \emph{not} be allowed. You will instead need a scientific calculator capable of performing exponentiation and logarithms for the exams. Using this calculator exclusively while doing homework will ensure that you are familiar with it for use during exams.

\paragraph{Academic Integrity:}
Scholastic dishonesty will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent (see \href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/06/33.html}{SUU Policy 6.33}). You are expected to have read and understood the current SUU student conduct code (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/11/02.html}{SUU Policy 11.2}) regarding student responsibilities and rights, the intellectual property policy (\href{https://www.suu.edu/policies/05/52.html}{SUU Policy 5.52}), information about procedures, and what constitutes acceptable behavior.

\paragraph{Mental Health:}
Mental and physical health are equal components to a holistic view of wellness and human thriving. Mental health should not be ignored, dismissed, or demeaned. If you find yourself struggling with mental health please visit \href{https://www.suu.edu/mentalhealth}{https://www.suu.edu/mentalhealth} for resources. There is also a link prominently on the right side of every Canvas page.

\paragraph{ADA Policy:}
Students with medical, psychological, learning, or other disabilities desiring academic adjustments, accommodations, or auxiliary aids will need to contact the Southern Utah University Coordinator of Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD), in Room 206F of the Sharwan Smith Center or phone (435) 865-8022. SSD determines eligibility for and authorizes the provision of services.

\paragraph{Emergency Management Statement:}
In case of emergency, the university's Emergency Notification System (ENS) will be activated. Students are encouraged to maintain updated contact information using the link on the homepage of the \emph{mySUU} portal. In addition, students are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the Emergency Response Protocols posted in each classroom. Detailed information about the university's emergency management plan can be found at: \href{http://www.suu.edu/emergency}{http://www.suu.edu/emergency}

\paragraph{HEOA Compliance Statement:}
The sharing of copyrighted material through peer-to- peer (P2P) file sharing, except as provided under U.S. copyright law, is prohibited by law. Detailed information can be found at: \href{https://help.suu.edu/article/1097/p2p-and-copyright-infringement}{https://help.suu.edu/article/1097/p2p-and-copyright-infringement}

\paragraph{LINK Statement:}
SUU faculty and staff care about the success of our students. In addition to your professor, numerous services are available to assist you with the achievement of your educational goals. SUU's LINK system may be used by faculty to notify you and/or your advisors of their concern for your progress and provide references to campus services as appropriate.

\paragraph{SUUSA Statement:}
As a student at SUU, you have representation from the SUU Student Association (SUUSA) which advocates for student interests and helps work as a liaison between the students and the university administration. You can submit My SUU Voice feedback by going here: \href{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/voice}{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/voice} Likewise, you can learn more about SUUSA's Executive Council here (\href{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/executive-council/}{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/executive-council/}) and about individual SUUSA's Student Senators here (\href{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/senate/}{https://www.suu.edu/suusa/senate/})

\paragraph{University Policies and Recommendations Regarding COVID-19:}
Southern Utah University has compiled a collection of information, policies, and recommendations related to COVID-19 at \href{https://www.suu.edu/coronavirus/}{suu.edu/coronavirus/}

\noindent I dearly want this semester to go smoothly vis-\`a-vis COVID-19, and I assume you all do as well. Toward that end, I encourage you all to exercise all reasonable precaution to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. This includes using the testing and self-reporting resources at the link above.

\noindent It may interest some of you to know that, for my part, I have been vaccinated with two doses of the Moderna vaccine, and more recently received a Pfizer booster. I will wear a mask on campus when appropriate. I will \emph{not} be wearing a mask as I lecture, since clear communication is my primary goal in the classroom.

\paragraph{Land Acknowledgement Statement}
SUU wishes to acknowledge and honor the Indigenous communities of this region as original possessors, stewards, and inhabitants of this Too’veep (land), and recognize that the University is situated on the traditional homelands of the Nung’wu (Southern Paiute People). We recognize that these lands have deeply rooted spiritual, cultural, and historical significance to the Southern Paiutes. We offer gratitude for the land itself, for the collaborative and resilient nature of the Southern Paiute people, and for the continuous opportunity to study, learn, work, and build community on their homelands here today. Consistent with the University's ongoing commitment to equity, diversity, and inclusion, SUU works towards building meaningful relationships with Native Nations and Indigenous communities through academic pursuits, partnerships, historical recognitions, community service, and student success efforts.
