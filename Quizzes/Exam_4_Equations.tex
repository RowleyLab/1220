\section*{\emph{Being}}
\paragraph{By Tanaya Winder}~
\begin{verse}
Wake up, greet the sun, and pray.\\
Burn cedar, sweet grass, sage—\\
sacred herbs to honor the lives we’ve been given,\\
for we have been gifted these ways since the beginning of time.\\
Remember, when you step into the arena of your life,\\
think about those who stand beside you, next to, and with you.\\
Your ancestors are always in your corner, along with your people.\\
When we enter this world we are born hungry,\\
our spirits long for us to live out our traditions\\
that have been passed down for generations.\\
Prayer, ceremony, dance, language—our ways of being.\\
Never forget you were put on this earth for a reason—\\
honor your ancestors.\\
Be a good relative. 
\end{verse}
