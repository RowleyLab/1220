	\subsection*{Question 1}
	At room temperature, iron has a body-centered cubic structure. Iron atoms have a radius of $126~pm$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give the coordination number of the iron atoms
		\item Find the length of the edge of a unit cell
		\item Estimate the density of iron metal. $\left(\vphantom{\dfrac{g}{cm^3}}\right.$The observed value is $\left.7.87~\dfrac{g}{cm^3}\right)$
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection*{Question 2}
	Lead has a face-centered cubic structure, and a density of $11.34~\dfrac{g}{cm^3}$
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Give the coordination number of the lead atoms
		\item Find the length of the edge of a unit cell
		\item Estimate lead's atomic radius. $\left(\vphantom{pm}\right.$The observed value is $\left.175~pm\right)$

  \section*{\emph{When You See Water}}
  \paragraph{By Alice Walker}~
  \begin{verse}
    When you see water in a stream\\
    you say: oh, this is stream\\
    water;\\
    When you see water in the river\\
    you say: oh, this is water\\
    of the river;\\
    When you see ocean\\
    water\\
    you say: This is the ocean's\\
    water!\\
    But actually water is always\\
    only itself\\
    and does not belong\\
    to any of these containers\\
    though it creates them.\\
    And so it is with you.
  \end{verse}

    \section*{\emph{Invictus}}
    \paragraph{By William Ernest Henley}~
    \begin{verse}
      Out of the night that covers me,\\
      \hspace{1em}Black as the pit from pole to pole,\\
      I thank whatever gods may be\\
      \hspace{1em}For my unconquerable soul.
      
      In the fell clutch of circumstance\\
      \hspace{1em}I have not winced nor cried aloud.\\
      Under the bludgeonings of chance\\
      \hspace{1em}My head is bloody, but unbowed.
      
      Beyond this place of wrath and tears\\
      \hspace{1em}Looms but the Horror of the shade,\\
      And yet the menace of the years\\
      \hspace{1em}Finds and shall find me unafraid.
      
      It matters not how strait the gate,\\
      \hspace{1em}How charged with punishments the scroll,\\
      I am the master of my fate,\\
      \hspace{1em}I am the captain of my soul.
    \end{verse}
  \end{minipage}
