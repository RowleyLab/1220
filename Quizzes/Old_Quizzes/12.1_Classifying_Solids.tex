	{\large Name: \rule[-1mm]{4in}{.1pt} 
	
	\subsection*{Question 1}
	Classify the following solids in as many ways as you can:
	
	\noindent {\large Quartz Crystal \hspace{3em} Naphthalene \hspace{3em} Aluminum Foil \hspace{3em} Glass \hspace{3em} Iron(III) Oxide}
	
	\vspace{3em}
	\subsection*{Question 2}
  For each property or observation, write whether it indicates a solid is amorphous or crystalline

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The atomic-scale structure is chaotic and disordered
    \item The solid cleaves easily along flat planes
    \item The solid shows flat faces and sharp corners and edges at the macroscopic scale
    \item A sharp, consistent melting point is observed
    \item The solid grows soft and pliable over a temperature range before finally melting
    \item The atomic-scale structure shows a regular, repeating order
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{2em}
  \subsection*{Question 3}
  What types of forces are present in each type of solid?
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Metallic Solids
    \item Ionic Solids
    \item Covalent-Network Solids
    \item Molecular Solids
  \end{itemize}

	\paragraph{By Maya Angelou}~
	\begin{verse}
		A free bird leaps\\
		on the back of the wind\\
		and floats downstream\\ 
		till the current ends\\
		and dips his wing\\
		in the orange sun rays\\
		and dares to claim the sky.
		
		But a bird that stalks\\
		down his narrow cage\\
		can seldom see through\\
		his bars of rage\\
		his wings are clipped and\\
		his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.
		
		The free bird thinks of another breeze\\
		and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees\\
		and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn\\
		and he names the sky his own
		
		But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams\\
		his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream\\
		his wings are clipped and his feet are tied\\
		so he opens his throat to sing.\\
		
		The caged bird sings\\
		with a fearful trill\\ 
		of things unknown\\
		but longed for still\\
		and his tune is heard\\
		on the distant hill\\
		for the caged bird\\
		sings of freedom.\\
