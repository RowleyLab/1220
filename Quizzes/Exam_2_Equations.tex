\section*{\emph{For the Boy Standing Under the Drainpipe}}
\paragraph{By Cheryl Savageau}~
\begin{verse}
He is wearing a fishermanâ€™s raincoat\\
a floppy rainhat with a long back brim\\
or he is not he is the boy standing under\\
the drainpipe in the full gushing\\
waterfall his eyes are closed\\
his head lifted into the full flow\\
or they are open wide under the\\
protective brim of his hat watching\\
the heavy streams enfold him he is\\
the boy standing under the drainpipe\\
and I am the girl watching he is\\
always there in spite of teachers\\
principals trips to the office it\\
rains and he finds the way to where\\
water falls dirty from the roof muddy\\
water plays over him where he\\
stands with hands outstretched or\\
by his sides where he spins or stands\\
still or circles slowly it is all he hears\\
the gushing voice of water the staccato\\
notes on shoulder and chest it is\\
the flowing the streaming\\
the warm or icy notes\\
their embrace\\
